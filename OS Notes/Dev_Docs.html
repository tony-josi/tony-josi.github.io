        <p><code>At this low level, we have a lot of power and responsibility over our computer, so we need to learn how to control it.</code>
        </p>
        <h2 id="bios">BIOS</h2>
        <p><strong><code>It is BIOS that loaded our 512-byte boot sector into memory and then, having finished its initialisations, told the CPU to jump to the start of our code, whereupon it began executing our first instruction, then the next, then the next, etc.</code></strong>
        </p>
        <p>When the computer boots, the BIOS doesn't know how to load the OS, so it delegates that task to the boot
            sector.
            Thus, the boot sector must be placed in a known, standard location. That location is the first sector of the
            disk
            (cylinder 0, head 0, sector 0) and it takes 512 bytes.</p>
        <p>To make sure that the &quot;disk is bootable&quot;, the BIOS checks that bytes 511 and 512 of the alleged
            boot sector
            are bytes 0xAA55.</p>
        <p><strong>BIOS cannot simply load a file that represents your operating system from a disk, since BIOS has no
                notion of
                a file- system. BIOS must read specific sectors of data (usually 512 bytes in size) from specific
                physical
                locations of the disk devices.</strong> So, the easiest place for BIOS to find our OS is in the first
            sector of
            one of the disks (i.e. Cylinder 0, Head 0, Sector 0), known as the boot sector.</p>
        <p>Again, an unsophisticated means is adopted here by BIOS, whereby the last two bytes of an intended boot
            sector must
            be set to the magic number <code>0xaa55</code>. So, BIOS loops through each storage device (e.g. floppy
            drive, hard
            disk, CD drive, etc.), reads the boot sector into memory, and <strong>instructs the CPU to begin executing
                the first
                boot sector it finds that ends with the magic
                number.</strong><br /><code>This is where we seize control of the computer.</code></p>
        <p>To compile: <code>nasm -f bin boot_sect_simple.asm -o boot_sect_simple.bin</code></p>
        <p>Run: qemu-system-x86_64 boot_sect_simple.bin</p>
        <h2 id="bit-real-mode">16-bit Real Mode</h2>
        <p>For backward compatibility, it is important that CPUs boot initially in 16-bit real mode, requiring modern
            operating
            systems explicitly to switch up into the more advanced 32-bit (or 64-bit) protected mode, but allowing older
            operating systems to carry on, blissfully unaware that they are running on a modern CPU</p>
        <h2 id="interupts">Interupts</h2>
        <p>BIOS adds some of its own ISRs to the interrupt vector that specialise in certain aspects of the computer,
            for
            example: interrupt 0x10 causes the screen-related ISR to be invoked; and interrupt 0x13, the disk-related
            I/O
            ISR.<br />However, it would be wasteful to allocate an interrupt per BIOS routine, so BIOS multiplexes the
            ISRs by
            what we could imagine as a big switch statement, based usually on the value set in one of the CPUs
            general<br />purpose registers, ax, prior to raising the interrupt.</p>
        <h2 id="location-of-boot-sector-in-memory-after-bios-loads-it">Location of Boot Sector in Memory after BIOS
            loads it
        </h2>
        <p>As it turns out, BIOS likes always to load the boot sector to the address <code>0x7c00</code>, where it is
            sure will
            not be occupied by important routines.</p>
        <p>BIOS has already being doing initialisation work on the computer long before it loaded our code, and will
            actually
            continue to service hardware interrupts for the clock, disk drives, and so on. So these BIOS routines (e.g.
            ISRs,
            services for screen printing, etc.) themselves must be stored somewhere in memory and must be preserved
            (i.e. not
            overwritten) whilst they are still of use.</p>

        <h2 id="adding-base-memory-with-offset-for-labels---org-0x7c00">Adding base memory with offset for labels -
            <code>[org 0x7c00]</code></h2>
        <p>BIOS does indeed load our boot sector to the address<br />0x7c00, and we have also seen how addressing and
            assembly
            code labels are related.<br />It is inconvenient to always have to account for this label--memory offset in
            your
            code, so many assemblers will correct label references during assemblege if you include the following
            instruction at
            the top of your code, telling it exactly where you expect the<br />code to loaded in memory:</p>
        <p><code>[org 0x7c00]</code></p>
        <p>It asks the assembler to make the literal map to exact location in memory.</p>
        <p>The ORG instruction is used to provide a &quot;hint&quot; to the assembler and the linker for the resulting
            object
            file. It allows you to specify the base address of the section of the file.</p>
        <h2 id="using-the-stack">Using the Stack</h2>
        <p>The stack is really just a simple solution to the following inconvenience: the CPU has a limited number of
            registers
            for the temporary storage of our routine’s local variables, but we often need more temporary storage than
            will fit
            into these registers; now, we can obviously make use of main memory, but specifying specific memory
            addresses when
            reading and writing is inconvenient, especially since we do not care exactly where the data is to be stored,
            only
            that we can retrieve it easily enough.</p>
        <p>The stack is implemented by two special CPU registers, bp and sp, which maintain the addresses of the stack
            base
            (i.e. the stack bottom) and the stack top respectively. Since the stack expands as we push data onto it, we
            usually
            set the stack’s base far away from important regions of memory (e.g. such as BIOS code or our code) so their
            is no
            danger of overwriting if the stack grows too large. One confusing thing about the stack is that it actually
            grows
            downwards from the base pointer, so when we issue a push, the value actually gets stored below --- and not
            above ---
            the address of bp, and sp is decremented by the value’s size.</p>
