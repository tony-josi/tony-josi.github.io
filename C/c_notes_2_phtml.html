        <h2 id="storage-duration-linkage">Storage duration &amp; Linkage</h2>
        <h3 id="storage-duration">Storage duration</h3>
        <p>Every object has a property called storage duration, which limits the object lifetime. There are four kinds
            of storage duration in C:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><code>automatic</code> storage duration. The storage is allocated when the block in which the object
                    was declared is entered and deallocated when it is exited by any means (goto, return, reaching the
                    end). One exception is the VLAs; their storage is allocated when the declaration is executed, not on
                    block entry, and deallocated when the declaration goes out of scope, not than when the block is
                    exited (since C99). If the block is entered recursively, a new allocation is performed for every
                    recursion level. All function parameters and non-static block-scope objects have this storage
                    duration, as well as compound literals used at block scope.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>static</code> storage duration. The storage duration is the entire execution of the program,
                    and the value stored in the object is initialized only once, prior to main function. All objects
                    declared static and all objects with either internal or external linkage that aren&#39;t declared
                    _Thread_local (since C11) have this storage duration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>thread</code> storage duration. The storage duration is the entire execution of the thread in
                    which it was created, and the value stored in the object is initialized when the thread is started.
                    Each thread has its own, distinct, object. If the thread that executes the expression that accesses
                    this object is not the thread that executed its initialization, the behavior is
                    implementation-defined. All objects declared _Thread_local have this storage duration.
                    (since C11)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>allocated</code> storage duration. The storage is allocated and deallocated on request, using
                    dynamic memory allocation functions.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="linkage">Linkage</h3>
        <p>Linkage refers to the ability of an identifier (variable or function) to be referred to in other scopes. If a
            variable or function with the same identifier is declared in several scopes, but cannot be referred to from
            all of them, then several instances of the variable are generated. The following linkages are recognized:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><code>no linkage</code>. The identifier can be referred to only from the scope it is in. All function
                    parameters and all non-extern block-scope variables (including the ones declared static) have this
                    linkage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>internal linkage</code>. The identifier can be referred to from all scopes in the current
                    translation unit. All static file-scope identifiers (both functions and variables) have this
                    linkage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>external linkage</code>. The identifier can be referred to from any other translation units in
                    the entire program. All non-static functions, all extern variables (unless earlier declared static),
                    and all file-scope non-static variables have this linkage.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the same identifier appears with both internal and external linkage in the same translation unit, the
            behavior is undefined. This is possible when tentative definitions are used.</p>

        <p>Each individual type in the C type system has several qualified versions of that type, corresponding to one,
            two, or all three of the const, volatile, and, for pointers to object types, restrict qualifiers. This page
            describes the effects of the restrict qualifier.</p>
        <h2 id="restrict-keyword">restrict keyword</h2>
        <p>During each execution of a block in which a restricted pointer P is declared (typically each execution of a
            function body in which P is a function parameter), if some object that is accessible through P (directly or
            indirectly) is modified, by any means, then all accesses to that object (both reads and writes) in that
            block must occur through P (directly or indirectly), otherwise the behavior is undefined:</p>

        <h2 id="why-is-the-use-of-alloca-not-considered-good-practice-">Why is the use of alloca() not considered good
            practice?</h2>
        <p>The answer is right there in the man page (at least on Linux):</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>RETURN VALUE The alloca() function returns a pointer to the beginning of the allocated space. If the
                allocation causes stack overflow, program behaviour is undefined.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Which isn&#39;t to say it should never be used. One of the OSS projects I work on uses it extensively, and as
            long as you&#39;re not abusing it (alloca&#39;ing huge values), it&#39;s fine. Once you go past the
            &quot;few hundred bytes&quot; mark, it&#39;s time to use malloc and friends, instead. You may still get
            allocation failures, but at least you&#39;ll have some indication of the failure instead of just blowing out
            the stack.</p>
        <h2 id="what-s-the-difference-between-a-vla-and-dynamic-memory-allocation-via-malloc-">What&#39;s the difference
            between a VLA and dynamic memory allocation via malloc?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Case 1: In</li>
        </ul>
        <p><code>char Buffer[MAX_BUF];</code></p>
        <p>Buffer is an array of size MAX_BUF. The allocation technique is called VLA.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Case 2: In</li>
        </ul>
        <p><code>const int MAX_BUF = 1000;</code></p>
        <p><code>char* Buffer = malloc(MAX_BUF);</code></p>
        <p>Buffer is a pointer which is allocated a memory of size MAX_BUF which is 1000.</p>
        <p>and, an array is not the same as a pointer, and C-FAQ has a Very Good collection detailing the reasons.</p>
        <p>The major difference, in terms of usability and behaviour are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(1) is on stack, usually Note, while (2) is on heap, always.</li>
            <li>(1) has fixed size once allocated, (2) can be resized.</li>
            <li>(1) is allocated when the enclosing function is called and has the block scope OTOH, (2) is allocated
                memory dynamically, at runtime and the returned memory has a lifetime which extends from the allocation
                until the deallocation.</li>
            <li>(1) allocated memory need not be managed by programmer, while in (2) all malloc()d memory should be
                free().</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="anonymous-structure">Anonymous Structure</h2>
        <p>Similar to union, an unnamed member of a struct whose type is a struct without name is known as anonymous
            struct. Every member of an anonymous struct is considered to be a member of the enclosing struct or union.
            This applies recursively if the enclosing struct or union is also anonymous.</p>

        <p>Similar to union, the behavior of the program is undefined if struct is defined without any named members
            (including those obtained via anonymous nested structs or unions).</p>
        <h2 id="forward-declaration">Forward declaration</h2>
        <p>A declaration of the following form</p>
        <p><code>struct name;</code></p>
        <p>hides any previously declared meaning for the name name in the tag name space and declares name as a new
            struct name in current scope, which will be defined later. Until the definition appears, this struct name
            has incomplete type.</p>
        <p>This allows structs that refer to each other:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-C"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> <span class="hljs-title">y</span></span>;

        <p>Note that a new struct name may also be introduced just by using a struct tag within another declaration, but

        <h2 id="storage-classes-in-c">Storage Classes in C</h2>
        <p>Syntax:</p>
        <p><code>storage_class var_data_type var_name;</code></p>
        <p>C language uses 4 storage classes, namely:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>auto</code>: This is the default storage class for all the variables declared inside a function or
                a block. Hence, the keyword auto is rarely used while writing programs in C language. Auto variables can
                be only accessed within the block/function they have been declared and not outside them (which defines
                their scope). Of course, these can be accessed within nested blocks within the parent block/function in
                which the auto variable was declared. However, they can be accessed outside their scope as well using
                the concept of pointers given here by pointing to the very exact memory location where the variables
                resides. They are assigned a garbage value by default whenever they are declared.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><code>extern</code>: Extern storage class simply tells us that the variable is defined elsewhere and not
                within the same block where it is used. Basically, the value is assigned to it in a different block and
                this can be overwritten/changed in a different block as well. So an extern variable is nothing but a
                global variable initialized with a legal value where it is declared in order to be used elsewhere. It
                can be accessed within any function/block. Also, a normal global variable can be made extern as well by
                placing the ‘extern’ keyword before its declaration/definition in any function/block. This basically
                signifies that we are not initializing a new variable but instead we are using/accessing the global
                variable only. The main purpose of using extern variables is that they can be accessed between two
                different files which are part of a large program. For more information on how extern variables work,
                have a look at this link.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><code>static</code>: This storage class is used to declare static variables which are popularly used
                while writing programs in C language. Static variables have a property of preserving their value even
                after they are out of their scope! Hence, static variables preserve the value of their last use in their
                scope. So we can say that they are initialized only once and exist till the termination of the program.
                Thus, no new memory is allocated because they are not re-declared. Their scope is local to the function
                to which they were defined. Global static variables can be accessed anywhere in the program. By default,
                they are assigned the value 0 by the compiler.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><code>register</code>: This storage class declares register variables which have the same functionality
                as that of the auto variables. The only difference is that the compiler tries to store these variables
                in the register of the microprocessor if a free register is available. This makes the use of register
                variables to be much faster than that of the variables stored in the memory during the runtime of the
                program. If a free register is not available, these are then stored in the memory only. Usually few
                variables which are to be accessed very frequently in a program are declared with the register keyword
                which improves the running time of the program. An important and interesting point to be noted here is
                that we cannot obtain the address of a register variable using pointers.</li>

        <h2 id="type-qualifiers">Type Qualifiers</h2>
        <p>There are four type qualifiers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>const</li>
            <li>volatile</li>
            <li>__unaligned (axp)</li>
            <li>
                <p>__restrict (pointer type only)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>const Type Qualifier</code> - Use the const type qualifier to qualify an object whose value
                    cannot be changed. Objects qualified by the const keyword cannot be modified. This means that an
                    object declared as const cannot serve as the operand in an operation that changes its value; for
                    example, the ++ and -- operators are not allowed on objects qualified with const . Using the const
                    qualifier on an object protects it from the side effects caused by operations that alter storage.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>volatile</code> - Every access (both read and write) made through an lvalue expression of
                    volatile-qualified type is considered an observable side effect for the purpose of optimization and
                    is evaluated strictly according to the rules of the abstract machine (that is, all writes are
                    completed at some time before the next sequence point). This means that within a single thread of
                    execution, a volatile access cannot be optimized out or reordered relative to another visible side
                    effect that is separated by a sequence point from the volatile access.
                    A cast of a non-volatile value to a volatile type has no effect. To access a non-volatile object
                    using volatile semantics, its address must be cast to a pointer-to-volatile and then the access must
                    be made through that pointer.
                    Any attempt to read or write to an object whose type is volatile-qualified through a non-volatile
                    lvalue results in undefined behavior:</p>

            removed, and any sequence of whitespace in the middle of the text (but not inside embedded string literals)
            is collapsed to a single space. This operation is called &quot;stringification&quot;. If the result of
            stringification is not a valid string literal, the behavior is undefined.</p>

            GDB can work with this debugging information. On most systems that use stabs format, -g enables use of extra
            debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information makes debugging work better in GDB but
            probably makes other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program. If you want to control for certain
            whether to generate the extra information, use -gstabs+, -gstabs, -gxcoff+, -gxcoff, or -gvms (see below).

        <p>A weak definition can be used to resolve any reference to that symbol in the same way as a normal definition.
            However, if another (non-weak) definition of that symbol exists in the build, the linker will use that
            definition instead of the weak definition, and not produce an error due to multiply-defined symbols.</p>

        <p>A simple or dummy implementation of a function can be provided as a WEAK definition. This allows the software

        <p>With the following declaration</p>
        <p><code>int array[ROW][COLUMN]={0};</code></p>
        <p>I get the array with all zeroes but with the following one</p>
        <p><code>int array[ROW][COLUMN]={1};</code></p>
        <p>I don’t get the array with all one value. The default value is still 0.</p>
        <p>Why this behavior and how can I initialize with all 1?</p>
        <hr>
        <p>You get this behavior, because <code>int array [ROW][COLUMN] = {1};</code>does not mean <strong>&quot;set all
                items to one&quot;</strong>. Let me try to explain how this works step by step.</p>
        <p>The explicit, overly clear way of initializing your array would be like this:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-C++"><span class="hljs-section">#define ROW 2</span>
        <span class="hljs-section">#define COLUMN 2</span>
        
        int array [<span class="hljs-string">ROW</span>][<span class="hljs-symbol">COLUMN</span>] =
        {
          {0, 0},
          {0, 0}
        };
        </code></pre>
        <p>However, C allows you to leave out some of the items in an array (or struct/union). You could for example
            write:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-C++">int array [<span class="hljs-string">ROW</span>][<span class="hljs-symbol">COLUMN</span>] =
        {
          {1, 2}
        };
        </code></pre>
        <p><strong>This means, initialize the first elements to 1 and 2, and the rest of the elements &quot;as if they
                had static storage duration&quot;.</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>There is a rule in C saying that all objects of static storage duration, that are not explicitly
                initialized by the programmer, must be set to zero.</strong></p>
        <p>So in the above example, the first row gets set to 1,2 and the next to 0,0 since we didn&#39;t give them any
            explicit values.</p>
        <p>Next, there is a rule in C allowing lax brace style. The first example could as well be written as</p>
        <p><code>int array [ROW][COLUMN] = {0, 0, 0, 0};</code></p>
        <p>although of course this is poor style, it is harder to read and understand. But this rule is convenient,
            because it allows us to write</p>
        <p><code>int array [ROW][COLUMN] = {0};</code></p>
        <p>which means: &quot;initialize the very first column in the first row to 0, and all other items as if they had
            static storage duration, ie set them to zero.&quot;</p>
        <p>therefore, if you attempt</p>
        <p><code>int array [ROW][COLUMN] = {1};</code></p>
        <p>it means <strong>&quot;initialize the very first column in the first row to 1 and set all other items to
                zero&quot;.</strong></p>

        </span>Works with BMP280_DATA_UPDATE_FREQ_U
        </code></pre>
        <p>In the above example the type of the macro BMP280_DATA_UPDATE_FREQ also affects the behaviour of the
            <code>if</code> expression thus adding required type information to macro can force the operation to be in
            the required type.</p>
        <p>In the first <code>if</code> above, the LHS is calculated as int and type of the macro value is int as well
            (C standard). The comparisson becomes -64535 &gt; 1000 which is false.</p>
        <p>But in the 2nd case the LHS is calculated as int and RHS is unsigned int thus the comparisson is done in
            unsigned int. So the int in LHS is casted to unsigned int, ie -64535 ==&gt; 2&#39;s Complement of 64535
            ==&gt; 1001. 1001 &gt; 1000 -&gt; True.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>When a suffix L or UL is not used, the compiler uses the first type that can contain the constant from a list
            (see details in sC99 standard, clause 6.4.4:5. For a decimal constant, the list is int, long int, long long
            int).</p>
        <p>As a consequence, most of the times, it is not necessary to use the suffix. It does not change the meaning of
            the program. It does not change the meaning of your example initialization of x for most architectures,
            although it would if you had chosen a number that could not be represented as a long long. See also
            codebauer&#39;s answer for an example where the U part of the suffix is necessary.</p>
        <p>There are a couple of circumstances when the programmer may want to set the type of the constant explicitly.
            One example is when using a variadic function:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-C"><span class="hljs-keyword">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"%lld"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>LL); <span class="hljs-regexp">//</span> correct, because <span class="hljs-number">1</span>LL has type long long
        <span class="hljs-keyword">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"%lld"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>);   <span class="hljs-regexp">//</span> undefined behavior, because <span class="hljs-number">1</span> has type <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>A common reason to use a suffix is ensuring that the result of a computation doesn&#39;t overflow. Two
            examples are:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-C"><span class="hljs-keyword">long</span> x = <span class="hljs-number">10000L</span> * <span class="hljs-number">4096L</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">unsigned</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">long</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">long</span> y = <span class="hljs-number">1U</span>LL &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-number">36</span>;
        </code></pre>
        <p>In both examples, without suffixes, the constants would have type int and the computation would be made as
            int. In each example this incurs a risk of overflow. Using the suffixes means that the computation will be
            done in a larger type instead, which has sufficient range for the result.</p>
        <p>As Lightness Races in Orbit puts it, the litteral&#39;s suffix comes before the assignment. In the two
            examples above, simply declaring x as long and y as unsigned long long is not enough to prevent the overflow
            in the computation of the expressions assigned to them.</p>
        <p>Another example is the comparison x &lt; 12U where variable x has type int. Without the U suffix, the
            compiler types the constant 12 as an int, and the comparison is therefore a comparison of signed ints.</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-C">int x = <span class="hljs-number">-3</span>;
        printf(<span class="hljs-string">"%d<span class="hljs-subst">\n</span>"</span>, x &lt; <span class="hljs-number">12</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// prints 1 because it's true that -3 &lt; 12</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>With the U suffix, the comparison becomes a comparison of unsigned ints. “Usual arithmetic conversions” mean
            that -3 is converted to a large unsigned int:</p>
        <p><code>printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, x &lt; 12U); // prints 0 because (unsigned int)-3 is large</code></p>
        <p>In fact, the type of a constant may even change the result of an arithmetic computation, again because of the
            way “usual arithmetic conversions” work.</p>
        <p>Note that, for decimal constants, the list of types suggested by C99 does not contain unsigned long long. In
            C90, the list ended with the largest standardized unsigned integer type at the time (which was unsigned
            long). A consequence was that the meaning of some programs was changed by adding the standard type long long
            to C99: the same constant that was typed as unsigned long in C90 could now be typed as a signed long long
            instead. I believe this is the reason why in C99, it was decided not to have unsigned long long in the list
            of types for decimal constants. </p>

        <p><strong>The C standard doesn&#39;t mandate any particular way of representing negative signed
                numbers.</strong></p>
        <p>In most implementations that you are likely to encounter, negative signed integers are stored in what is
            called two&#39;s complement. The other major way of storing negative signed numbers is called one&#39;s
            complement.</p>
        <p>The <strong>two&#39;s complement</strong> of an N-bit number x is defined as 2^N - x. For example, the
            two&#39;s complement of 8-bit 1 is 2^8 - 1, or 1111 1111. The two&#39;s complement of 8-bit 8 is 2^8 - 8,
            which in binary is 1111 1000. This can also be calculated by flipping the bits of x and adding one. For

        <p>Two&#39;s complement has several advantages over one&#39;s complement. For example, it doesn&#39;t have the
            concept of &#39;negative zero&#39;, which for good reason is confusing to many people. Addition,
            multiplication and subtraction work the same with signed integers implemented with two&#39;s complemented as
            they do with unsigned integers as well.</p>

        <p>This is the easiest to understand, because it works the same as we are used to when dealing with negative
            decimal values: The first position (bit) represents the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative), and the other
            bits represent the number. Although it is easy for us to understand, it is hard for computers to work with,
            especially when doing arithmetic with negative numbers.
            In 8-bit signed magnitude, the value 8 is represented as 0 0001000 and -8 as 1 0001000.</p>

        <p>C was designed to implicitly and silently change the integer types of the operands used in expressions. There
            exist several cases where the language forces the compiler to either change the operands to a larger type,
            or to change their signedness.</p>
        <p>The rationale behind this is to prevent accidental overflows during arithmetic, but also to allow operands
            with different signedness to co-exist in the same expression.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the rules for implicit type promotion cause much more harm than good, to the point where they
            might be one of the biggest flaws in the C language. These rules are often not even known by the average C
            programmer and therefore causing all manner of very subtle bugs.</p>
        <p>Typically you see scenarios where the programmer says &quot;just cast to type x and it works&quot; - but they
            don&#39;t know why. Or such bugs manifest themselves as rare, intermittent phenomenon striking from within
            seemingly simple and straight-forward code. Implicit promotion is particularly troublesome in code doing bit
            manipulations, since most bit-wise operators in C come with poorly-defined behavior when given a signed
            operand.</p>
        <h3 id="integer-types-and-conversion-rank">Integer types and conversion rank</h3>
        <p>The integer types in C are char, short, int, long, long long and enum.
            _Bool/bool is also treated as an integer type when it comes to type promotions.</p>
        <p>All integers have a specified conversion rank. C11 6.3.1.1, emphasis mine on the most important parts:</p>
        <p>Every integer type has an integer conversion rank defined as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No two signed integer types shall have the same rank, even if they have the same representation.</li>
            <li>The rank of a signed integer type shall be greater than the rank of any signed integer type with less
                precision.</li>
            <li>The rank of long long int shall be greater than the rank of long int, which shall be greater than the
                rank of int, which shall be greater than the rank of short int, which shall be greater than the rank of
                signed char.</li>
            <li>The rank of any unsigned integer type shall equal the rank of the corresponding signed integer type, if
                any.</li>
            <li>The rank of any standard integer type shall be greater than the rank of any extended integer type with
                the same width.</li>
            <li>The rank of char shall equal the rank of signed char and unsigned char.</li>
            <li>The rank of _Bool shall be less than the rank of all other standard integer types.</li>
            <li>The rank of any enumerated type shall equal the rank of the compatible integer type (see 6.7.2.2).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The types from stdint.h sort in here too, with the same rank as whatever type they happen to correspond to on
            the given system. For example, int32_t has the same rank as int on a 32 bit system.</p>
        <p>Further, C11 6.3.1.1 specifies which types that are regarded as the small integer types (not a formal term):
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The following may be used in an expression wherever an int or unsigned int may be used:</p>
            <p>— An object or expression with an integer type (other than int or unsigned int) whose integer conversion
                rank is less than or equal to the rank of int and unsigned int.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>What this somewhat cryptic text means in practice, is that _Bool, char and short (and also int8_t, uint8_t
            etc) are the &quot;small integer types&quot;. These are treated in special ways and subject to implicit
            promotion, as explained below.</p>
        <h3 id="the-integer-promotions">The integer promotions</h3>
        <p>Whenever a small integer type is used in an expression, it is implicitly converted to int which is always
            signed. This is known as the integer promotions or the integer promotion rule.</p>
        <p>Formally, the rule says (C11 6.3.1.1):</p>
        <p>If an int can represent all values of the original type (as restricted by the width, for a bit-field), the
            value is converted to an int; otherwise, it is converted to an unsigned int. These are called the integer
            promotions.</p>
        <p>This means that all small integer types, no matter signedness, get implicitly converted to (signed) int when
            used in most expressions.</p>
        <p>This text is often misunderstood as: &quot;all small, signed integer types are converted to signed int and
            all small, unsigned integer types are converted to unsigned int&quot;. This is incorrect. The unsigned part
            here only means that if we have for example an unsigned short operand, and int happens to have the same size
            as short on the given system, then the unsigned short operand is converted to unsigned int. As in, nothing
            of note really happens. But in case short is a smaller type than int, it is always converted to (signed)
            int, regardless of it the short was signed or unsigned!</p>
        <p>The harsh reality caused by the integer promotions means that almost no operation in C can be carried out on
            small types like char or short. Operations are always carried out on int or larger types.</p>
        <p>This might sound like nonsense, but luckily the compiler is allowed to optimize the code. For example, an
            expression containing two unsigned char operands would get the operands promoted to int and the operation
            carried out as int. But the compiler is allowed to optimize the expression to actually get carried out as an
            8 bit operation, as would be expected. However, here comes the problem: the compiler is not allowed to
            optimize out the implicit change of signedness caused by the integer promotion. Because there is no way for
            the compiler to tell if the programmer is purposely relying on implicit promotion to happen, or if it is
            unintentional.</p>
        <p>This is why example 1 in the question fails. Both unsigned char operands are promoted to type int, the
            operation is carried out on type int, and the result of x - y is of type int. Meaning that we get -1 instead
            of 255 which might have been expected. The compiler may generate machine code that executes the code with 8
            bit instructions instead of int, but it may not optimize out the change of signedness. Meaning that we end
            up with a negative result, that in turn results in a weird number when printf(&quot;%u is invoked. Example 1
            could be fixed by casting the result of the operation back to type unsigned char.</p>
        <p>With the exception of a few special cases like ++ and sizeof operators, the integer promotions apply to
            almost all operations in C, no matter if unary, binary (or ternary) operators are used.</p>
        <h3 id="the-usual-arithmetic-conversions">The usual arithmetic conversions</h3>
        <p>Usual arithmetic conversion by which operands of arithmetic operators are converted to a common type. It
            begins by promoting the operand (to either int or unsigned) if they are of a type smaller than int and then
            choosing a target type by the following process (for integer types, 6.3.1.8/1) (Listed below as bullets).
        </p>
        <p>Whenever a binary operation (an operation with 2 operands) is done in C, both operands of the operator have
            to be of the same type. Therefore, in case the operands are of different types, C enforces an implicit
            conversion of one operand to the type of the other operand. The rules for how this is done are named the
            usual artihmetic conversions (sometimes informally referred to as &quot;balancing&quot;). These are
            specified in C11 6.3.18:</p>
        <p>(Think of this rule as a long, nested if-else if statement and it might be easier to read :) )</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>6.3.1.8 Usual arithmetic conversions</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Many operators that expect operands of arithmetic type cause conversions and yield result types in a similar
            way. The purpose is to determine a common real type for the operands and result. For the specified operands,
            each operand is converted, without change of type domain, to a type whose corresponding real type is the
            common real type. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the common real type is also the corresponding real
            type of the result, whose type domain is the type domain of the operands if they are the same, and complex
            otherwise. This pattern is called the usual arithmetic conversions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, if the corresponding real type of either operand is long double, the other operand is converted,
                without change of type domain, to a type whose corresponding real type is long double.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if the corresponding real type of either operand is double, the other operand is converted,
                without change of type domain, to a type whose corresponding real type is double.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if the corresponding real type of either operand is float, the other operand is converted,
                without change of type domain, to a type whose corresponding real type is float.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Otherwise, the integer promotions are performed on both operands. Then the following rules are
                    applied to the promoted operands:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If both operands have the same type, then no further conversion is needed.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer types, the
                        operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand
                        with greater rank.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank
                        of the type of the other operand, then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the
                        type of the operand with unsigned integer type.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values
                        of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type, then the operand with unsigned integer
                        type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of
                        the operand with signed integer type.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notable here is that the usual arithmetic conversions apply to both floating point and integer variables. In
            case of integers, we can also note that the integer promotions are invoked from within the usual arithmetic
            conversions. And after that, when both operands have at least the rank of int, the operators are balanced to
            the same type, with the same signedness.</p>
        <p>This is the reason why a + b in example 2 gives a strange result. Both operands are integers and they are at
            least of rank int, so the integer promotions do not apply. The operands are not of the same type - a is
            unsigned int and b is signed int. Therefore the operator b is temporarily converted to type unsigned int.
            During this conversion it loses the sign information and ends up as a large value.</p>
        <p>The reason why changing type to short in example 3 fixes the problem, is because short is a small integer
            type. Meaning that both operands are integer promoted to type int which is signed. After integer promotion,
            both operands have the same type (int), no further conversion is needed. And then the operation can be
            carried out on a signed type as expected.</p>

            <li>Why does this give a strange, large integer number and not 255?</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="lang-C++"><span class="hljs-keyword">unsigned</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">char</span> x = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;

        </code></pre>
        <p>Ans:</p>
        <p>Based on the integer promotion rules both x and y are small integer types, they are type casted implicitly to
            int before <code>-</code> operation. But as the <code>x - y</code> expression is a temporary result in
            printf() and is not assigned to another typed variable, the evaluted result of the expression still stays as
            int. And thus
            <code>int 0 - int 1 = int 0xFFFFFFFF</code> and thats why it prints 0xFFFFFFFF.</p>

        </code></pre>
        <p>Ans:</p>
        <p><strong>As both a and b are having types are having at least the rank of <code>int</code>, so the integer
                promotions do not apply.</strong> Based on the usual arithmetic conversions, b is typecasted to unsigned
            int. Thus the expression is evaluted as and to unsigned int. In the comparisson operation the value 0 is of
            type int, so 0 is also converted to the type unsigned int. Thus, causing a greater value (1 + 0xFFFFFFFE =
            0xFFFFFFFF) at the LHS of &gt; operator.</p>

        <p>Ans:</p>
        <p><strong>As both a and b are having types with rank less than rank of <code>int</code> the integer promotions
                do apply.</strong>
            Both a and b are converted to int before operation. Thus the expression is evaluted as and to int. Causing a

        <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38854596/integer-conversion-rank-and-promotion">refer</a></p>
        <p>Regarding what happens during a promotion / conversion on the bit level, let&#39;s first assume that the
            lower rank type is smaller than the higher rank type, and that signed types use 2&#39;s complement
            representation.</p>
        <p>For a conversion from a 32 bit int to a 64 bit long, if the value is positive, 4 bytes containing all 0 bits
            are added on the left. If the value is negative, 4 bytes containing all 1 bits are added on the left. For
            example, the representation of value 5 changes from 0x00000005 to 0x0000000000000005. For the value -5, the
            representation changes from 0xfffffffb to 0xfffffffffffffffb.</p>

        <p>Why is the output not equal ?</p>

        </p>
        <p>This happens because in your statement</p>
        <p><code>if(f == 0.7)</code></p>
        <p>the 0.7 is treated as a double.</p>
        <p><strong>you should never test for exact equality of floating-point values.</strong></p>
        <p>More elaborate explanation:</p>
        <p>In the line <code>float f = 0.7;</code> the double value 0.7 is converted to float first. Then in
            <code>if(f == 0.7)</code> f is converted to double as RHS 0.7 is also double, based on <strong>usual
                arithemetic conversion</strong> rules (refer above).</p>
        <p>Note that 0.7 is not representable exactly either as a float (or as a double). If it was represented exactly,
            then there would be no loss of information when converting to float and then back to double, and you
            wouldn&#39;t have this problem.</p>
        <p><strong>All non-integer numbers that can be represented exactly have 5 as their last decimal digit.
                Unfortunately, the converse is not true: some numbers have 5 as their last decimal digit and cannot be
                represented exactly.</strong></p>

            unexpected result?</h2>
        <p>The important factors under consideration with float or double numbers are:
            Precision &amp; Rounding</p>
        <h4 id="precision-">Precision:</h4>
        <p>The precision of a floating point number is how many digits it can represent without losing any information
            it contains.</p>
        <p>Consider the fraction 1/3. The decimal representation of this number is 0.33333333333333… with 3′s going out
            to infinity. An infinite length number would require infinite memory to be depicted with exact precision,
            but float or double data types typically only have 4 or 8 bytes. Thus Floating point &amp; double numbers
            can only store a certain number of digits, and the rest are bound to get lost. Thus, there is no definite
            accurate way of representing float or double numbers with numbers that require more precision than the
            variables can hold.</p>
        <h4 id="rounding-">Rounding:</h4>
        <p>There is a non-obvious differences between binary and decimal (base 10) numbers.
            Consider the fraction 1/10. In decimal, this can be easily represented as 0.1, and 0.1 can be thought of as
            an easily representable number. However, in binary, 0.1 is represented by the infinite sequence:
            0.00011001100110011…</p>
        <p>An example:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-C++"><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-meta-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-meta-string">&lt;iomanip&gt;</span></span>
        <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">main</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>
        </span>{
            <span class="hljs-keyword">using</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">namespace</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>;
            <span class="hljs-built_in">cout</span> &lt;&lt; setprecision(<span class="hljs-number">17</span>);
            <span class="hljs-keyword">double</span> dValue = <span class="hljs-number">0.1</span>;
            <span class="hljs-built_in">cout</span> &lt;&lt; dValue &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-built_in">endl</span>;
        }
        </code></pre>
        <p>This output is:</p>
        <p><code>0.10000000000000001</code></p>
        <p>And not</p>
        <p><code>0.1.</code></p>
        <p>This is because the double had to truncate the approximation due to it’s limited memory, which results in a
            number that is not exactly 0.1. Such an scenario is called a Rounding error.</p>
        <p>Whenever comparing two close float and double numbers such rounding errors kick in and eventually the
            comparison yields incorrect results and this is the reason you should never compare floating point numbers
            or double using ==.</p>
        <p>The best you can do is to take their difference and check if it is less than an epsilon.</p>
        <p><code>abs(x - y) &lt; epsilon</code></p>

        <p><strong>Thread-local storage (TLS)</strong> is a mechanism by which variables are allocated such that there
            is one instance of the variable per extant thread. The runtime model GCC uses to implement this originates
            in the IA-64 processor-specific ABI, but has since been migrated to other processors as well. I</p>
        <p>At the user level, the extension is visible with a new storage class keyword: __thread. For example:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-C"><span class="hljs-keyword">__thread</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">extern</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">__thread</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> state s;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">__thread</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">char</span> *p;
        </code></pre>
        <p>The <strong>thread specifier may be used alone, with the extern or static specifiers, but with no other
                storage class specifier. When used with extern or static, </strong>thread must appear immediately after
            the other storage class specifier.</p>
        <p>In C++, if an initializer is present for a thread-local variable, it must be a constant-expression, as
            defined in 5.19.2 of the ANSI/ISO C++ standard.</p>
