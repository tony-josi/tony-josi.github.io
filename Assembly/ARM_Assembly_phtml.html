        <h2 id="about-arm-and-thumb-mode">About ARM and Thumb Mode</h2>
        <p>ARM and Thumb are two different instruction sets supported by ARM cores with a “T” in their
            name. For instance, ARM7 TDMI supports Thumb mode. ARM instructions are 32 bits wide, and
            Thumb instructions are 16 wide. Thumb mode allows for code to be smaller, and can potentially be
            faster if the target has slow memory. </p>
        <h2 id="subroutines">Subroutines</h2>
        <h4 id="transferring-control-from-calling-program-to-a-subroutine">Transferring control from calling program to
            a subroutine</h4>
        <p>and back</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Necessary to save the return address, then branch to the subroutine.</li>
            <li>This can be accomplished in ARM using the branch and link instruction bl -&gt; <code>bl subr_name</code>
            </li>
            <li>To transfer control back to the calling program, can use the branch and exchange instruction bx -&gt;
                <code>bx lr</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Alternatively, you can pop the lr register into the pc</p>
        <h2 id="branch-instructions">Branch Instructions</h2>
        <h4 id="bl-directive">BL directive</h4>
        <p>The format of the BL directive is:</p>
        <p><code>bl{Condition} Destination Address</code></p>
        <p>BL is another jump instruction, but before jumping, it saves the current contents of the PC in register R14,
            so it can be executed by reloading the contents of the R14 to the PC to return to the command after the jump
            instruction. This directive is a basic but commonly used means of implementing subroutine invocation. The
            following directives:</p>
        <p>BL label; When the program unconditionally jumps to the label label at the time of execution, the current PC
            value is saved to R14 </p>
        <h4 id="blx-instruction">BLX instruction</h4>
        <p>The format of the BLX directive is:</p>
        <p><code>BLX Destination Address</code></p>
        <p>The BLX instruction jumps from the arm instruction set to the destination address specified in the
            instruction and switches the processor&#39;s working state to the thumb state, which simultaneously saves
            the current contents of the PC to the register R14. Therefore, when the subroutine uses the thumb
            instruction set, and the caller uses the arm instruction set, the subroutine&#39;s call and the
            processor&#39;s working state can be toggled through the BLX instruction.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the return of the subroutine can be done by copying the register R14 value to the PC.</p>
        <h4 id="bx-instruction">BX instruction</h4>
        <p>The format of BX instruction is:</p>
        <p><code>bx{Condition} Destination Address</code></p>
        <p>The BX instruction jumps to the target address specified in the instruction, and the instruction at the
            destination address can be either an arm instruction or a thumb command. </p>
        <h2 id="program-status-register">Program Status Register</h2>
        <p>The Program Status Register (PSR) combines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Application Program Status Register (APSR)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Interrupt Program Status Register (IPSR)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Execution Program Status Register (EPSR).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="link-register">Link register</h2>
        <p>A link register is a special-purpose register which holds the address to return to when a function call
            completes.</p>
        <h3 id="the-condition-flags">The condition flags</h3>
        <p>The APSR contains the following condition flags:</p>
        <p>N Set to 1 when the result of the operation was negative, cleared to 0 otherwise.</p>
        <p>Z Set to 1 when the result of the operation was zero, cleared to 0 otherwise.</p>
        <p>C Set to 1 when the operation resulted in a carry, cleared to 0 otherwise.</p>
        <p>V Set to 1 when the operation caused overflow, cleared to 0 otherwise.</p>
        <h2 id="-export-and-global-"><code>EXPORT</code> and <code>GLOBAL</code></h2>
        <p>Specifies exports using this syntax:</p>
        <p><code>EXPORT|GLOBAL sym{[type]}</code></p>
        <p>sym is the symbol to be exported. [type], if specified, can be either [DATA] to indicate that the symbol
            points to data or [FUNC] to indicate that the symbol points to code. GLOBAL is a synonym for EXPORT.</p>
        <h2 id="push-and-pop">PUSH and POP</h2>
        <p>Push registers onto, and pop registers off a full-descending stack.</p>
        <p>Syntax</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-s"><span class="hljs-keyword">PUSH </span>reglist
<span class="hljs-keyword">POP </span>reglist
</code></pre>
        <p>where:</p>
        <p>reglist Is a non-empty list of registers, enclosed in braces. It can contain register ranges.</p>
        <p>It must be comma separated if it contains more than one register or register range.
            Operation</p>
        <p>PUSH stores registers on the stack, with the lowest numbered register using the lowest memory
            address and the highest numbered register using the highest memory address.
            POP loads registers from the stack, with the lowest numbered register using the lowest memory
            address and the highest numbered register using the highest memory address.</p>
        <p>PUSH uses the value in the SP register minus four as the highest memory address, POP uses the
            value in the SP register as the lowest memory address, implementing a full-descending stack.
            On completion, PUSH updates the SP register to point to the location of the lowest store value,</p>
        <p>POP updates the SP register to point to the location above the highest location loaded.</p>
        <p>If a POP instruction includes PC in its reglist, a branch to this location is performed when the</p>
        <p>POP instruction has completed. Bit[0] of the value read for the PC is used to update the APSR T-bit. This bit
            must be 1 to ensure correct operation.</p>
        <h2 id="mov-and-mvn">MOV and MVN</h2>

            result of the operation, see Conditional execution on page 3-9.</p>
        <p>Rd Is the destination register.</p>
        <p>The MOVS instruction performs the same operation as the MOV instruction, but also updates the N
            and Z flags.</p>

        <h2 id="what-does-the-h-suffix-mean">What does the 'h' suffix mean?</h2>
        <p>In x86 assembly, what does an h suffix on numbers represent?</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p><code>sub CX, 13h</code></p>
        <p><strong>&quot;H&quot; for &quot;Hexadecimal&quot;</strong></p>
        <h2 id="registers">Registers</h2>
        <p>Modern (i.e 386 and beyond) x86 processors have eight 32-bit general purpose registers, as depicted in Figure
            1. The
            register names are mostly historical. For example, EAX used to be called the accumulator since it was used
            by a
            number of arithmetic operations, and ECX was known as the counter since it was used to hold a loop index.
            Whereas
            most of the registers have lost their special purposes in the modern instruction set, by convention, two are
            reserved for special purposes — the stack pointer (ESP) and the base pointer (EBP).</p>
        <p>For the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers, subsections may be used. For example, the least significant 2 bytes
            of EAX
            can be treated as a 16-bit register called AX. The least significant byte of AX can be used as a single
            8-bit
            register called AL, while the most significant byte of AX can be used as a single 8-bit register called AH.
            These
            names refer to the same physical register. When a two-byte quantity is placed into DX, the update affects
            the value
            of DH, DL, and EDX. These sub-registers are mainly hold-overs from older, 16-bit versions of the instruction
            set.
            However, they are sometimes convenient when dealing with data that are smaller than 32-bits (e.g. 1-byte
            ASCII
            characters).</p>
        <p>When referring to registers in assembly language, the names are not case-sensitive. For example, the names
            EAX and
            eax refer to the same register.</p>
        <p>AX is the 16 lower bits of EAX. AH is the 8 high bits of AX (i.e. the bits 8-15 of EAX) and AL is the least
            significant byte (bits 0-7) of EAX as well as AX.</p>
        <p>Example (Hexadecimal digits):</p>
        <p>EAX: 12 34 56 78<br />AX: 56 78<br />AH: 56<br />AL: 78</p>
        <h2 id="int-x86-instruction">INT (x86 instruction)</h2>
        <p>INT is an assembly language instruction for x86 processors that generates a software interrupt. It takes the
            interrupt number formatted as a byte value.[1]</p>
        <p>When written in assembly language, the instruction is written like this:</p>
        <p><code>INT X</code></p>
        <p>where X is the software interrupt that should be generated (0-255).</p>
        <p>Depending on the context, compiler, or assembler, a software interrupt number is often given as a hexadecimal
            value,
            sometimes with a prefix 0x or the suffix h. For example, INT 13H will generate the software interrupt 0x13
            (19 in
            decimal), causing the function pointed to by the 20th vector in the interrupt table to be executed, which is
            typically a DOS API call.</p>
        <h2 id="int-10h">INT 10H</h2>
        <p>INT 10h, INT 10H or INT 16 is shorthand for BIOS interrupt call 10hex, the 17th interrupt vector in an
            x86-based
            computer system. The BIOS typically sets up a real mode interrupt handler at this vector that provides video
            services. Such services include setting the video mode, character and string output, and graphics primitives
            (reading and writing pixels in graphics mode).</p>
        <p>To use this call, load AH with the number of the desired subfunction, load other required parameters in other
            registers, and make the call. INT 10h is fairly slow, so many programs bypass this BIOS routine and access
            the
            display hardware directly. Setting the video mode, which is done infrequently, can be accomplished by using
            the
            BIOS, while drawing graphics on the screen in a game needs to be done quickly, so direct access to video RAM
            is more
            appropriate than making a BIOS call for every pixel.</p>
        <h2 id="defining-strings">Defining Strings</h2>
        <p>The convention is to declare strings as null-terminating, which means we always declare the last byte of the
            string
            as 0, as follows:</p>
        <pre class="asm"><code>my_string:
    db ’Booting OS’,0</code></pre>
        <p>When later iterating through a string, perhaps to print each of its characters in turn, we can easily
            determine when
            we have reached the end.</p>
        <h2 id="function-calls">Function Calls</h2>
        <p>At the CPU level a function is nothing more than a jump to the address of a useful routine then a jump back
            again to
            the instruction immediately following the first jump.</p>
        <p>The caller code could store the correct return address (i.e. the address immediately after the call) in some
            well-known location, then the called code could jump back to that stored address. The CPU keeps track of the
            current
            instruction being executed in the special register ip (instruction pointer), which, sadly, we cannot access
            directly. However, the CPU provides a pair of instructions, call and ret, which do exactly what we want:
            call
            behaves like jmp but additionally, before actually jumping, pushes the return address on to the stack; ret
            then pops
            the return address off the stack and jumps to it.</p>
        <p>When we call a function, such as a print function, within our assembly program, internally that function may
            alter
            the values of several registers to perform its job (indeed, with registers being a scarce resource, it will
            almost
            certainly do this), so when our program returns from the function call it may not be safe to assume, say,
            the value
            we stored in dx will still be there.</p>
        <p>It is often sensible (and polite), therefore, for a function immediately to push any registers it plans to
            alter onto
            the stack and then pop them off again (i.e. restore the registers’ original values) immediately before it
            returns.
            Since a function may use many of the general purpose registers, the CPU implements two convenient
            instructions,
            <code>pusha</code> and <code>popa</code>, that conveniently push and pop all registers to and from the stack
            respectively.</p>
        <p>Examlmple:</p>
        <pre class="asm"><code>some_function:
    pusha
    mov bx, 10 add bx, 20 mov ah, 0x0e int 0x10 popa
    ret</code></pre>
        <h2 id="include-files">Include Files</h2>
        <p>After slaving away even on the seemingly simplest of assembly routines, you will likely want to reuse your
            code in
            multiple programs. nasm allows you to include external files literally as follows:</p>
        <pre class="asm"><code>%include &quot;my_print_function.asm&quot; ; this will simply get replaced by 
; the contents of the file
...
mov al, ’H’ ; Store ’H’ in al so our function will print it. 
call my_print_function
</code></pre>
        <p><strong>IMP: remember to include subroutines below the hang ie, jmp $</strong></p>
